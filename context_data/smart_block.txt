Just some time back, we released these amazing LLM-powered features. And for those of you who don’t know about it, let us quickly jog your memory. 

Smart Block empowers users to craft intuitive and human-like conversation flows through straightforward prompts. Meanwhile, AnswerFlow enables you to extract coherent responses from pre-uploaded documents, leveraging document cognition. 

Now, we’ve seamlessly integrated the remarkable capabilities of AnswerFlow into Smart Block, enhancing the intelligence and efficiency of conversation flows.

Without any further delay let us tell you how this amalgamation helps your business, especially if you are looking for a conversation automation solution that is not just human-like but also smart.

The Power Duo: Smart Block Meets AnswerFlow
We’re thrilled to announce that these two exceptional tools, Smart Block and AnswerFlow, have now joined forces. This integration brings forth a new era of intelligent and efficient conversation automation.

The AnswerFlow feature serves to offer context to the LLM-powered Smart Block when a customer poses a question beyond the scope of the written prompts. Subsequently, the Smart Block utilises AnswerFlow’s response internally to generate a tailored response for the end customer.

Our objective is to enhance the end customer experience by enabling you to attach AnswerFlow to the SmartAI block and apply relevant tags. This facilitates the swift delivery of accurate information using LLM models, ensuring a more efficient and satisfactory interaction.

Key Benefits of the Integration
Contextual Responses
With AnswerFlow integrated into Smart Block, the system gains the ability to understand and respond contextually to a broader range of customer queries. This ensures that customers receive relevant and accurate information, even for inquiries beyond the scope of predefined prompts.

Improved Customer Experience
The amalgamation of AnswerFlow with Smart Block is designed with a singular focus – to enhance the end customer’s experience. By leveraging the intelligence of LLM models and document cognition, businesses can provide quicker and more apt responses, fostering a seamless and engaging interaction.

Decreased Reliance on Agents
Uploading pertinent documents such as policies and SLAs allows you to craft more intelligent conversation flows. This empowers the bot to address a myriad of questions, ultimately diminishing the volume of queries redirected to agents. Agents can now concentrate solely on intricate issues that demand their undivided attention.

Streamlined Workflow with Tags
Clients can now apply relevant tags to Smart Block for relevant documents that they want the bot to fetch answers from. This not only streamlines workflow management but also adds a layer of customisation, allowing businesses to tailor interactions based on specific contexts or topics.

Rapid Response Synthesis
The integration allows the Smart block to leverage AnswerFlow’s responses swiftly. When faced with questions not covered in the prompt, the synthesis process becomes more dynamic, enabling the bot to respond to customers promptly and accurately.

Faster Issue Resolution
The integrated approach expedites issue resolution. With AnswerFlow providing a crucial context, Smart Block can swiftly navigate through potential queries, offering a seamless and quicker problem-solving experience for customers.

Response Related Instructions
Tailor how the bot replies to customers when generating responses using AnswerFlow documents. You can provide specific instructions in the “Response related instructions” section. This gives you more control over how the LLM powered bot responds to your customers.
