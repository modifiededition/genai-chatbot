Analysing Agents Conversations Just Became Easier – Introducing Sparks

An average agent handles more than 250 conversations each month, addressing customer inquiries and delivering sales-focused experiences. This substantial workload places a considerable burden on managers and quality analysts (QAs). Reviewing all conversations within the required timeframe is nearly impossible, resulting in missed conversation assessments. 

But if we tell you now, there is a way where a QA can now easily check all the conversations for SLAs, escalations and overall quality of the engagement in a heartbeat. 

Yes, you heard us right!

We bring you a solution – LLM-powered Sparks by Verloop.io. This tool enables QAs to effortlessly examine all conversations for SLAs, escalations, and overall engagement quality in an instant. With Sparks, quality assurance becomes quicker and more efficient, ensuring no conversation analysis is overlooked.

Before we get started, let us quickly tell you about the Sparks.

Introducing Sparks – A Game-Changer in Conversation Analysis
In its Phase 1 release, Sparks is a transformative feature that empowers administrators to elevate conversation analysis by creating and managing specific instances known as Sparks. These Sparks offer valuable insights, allowing managers and QA to track defined instances in conversations. 

For instance, they can create a Spark to check if the agent has greeted the customer at the start of the conversation. Simply add the prompt to define the Spark and add the instance checklist with instructions and you are all set. This feature enables a seamless check of individual conversations or the entire database to ensure adherence to defined criteria as SLAs. 

QAs can check if a particular agent is adhering to the defined SLAs, or script or not. Sparks can revolutionise the efficiency of conversation monitoring and quality assurance.

Sparks additionally enable managers to review instance occurrences and their frequency within a single conversation or across the entire conversation database.

Now you must be thinking, why did we decide to create a solution like Sparks? 

Let us tell you why. 

Why is Spark Needed?
Many organisations delivering customer support through interactions grapple with the challenge of maintaining consistent and high-quality service. A key issue they face is the inefficient and inconsistent nature of quality control processes for conversations, marked by the following challenges:

1. Manual Quality Control
 Presently, quality control heavily relies on human agents manually selecting and reviewing a small percentage (typically 1-2%) of conversations handled by support agents. This approach is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and often lacks thoroughness due to its limited scope.

2. Inadequate Sampling
The limited sample size chosen for quality control may not accurately represent the full spectrum of customer interactions. This oversight can lead to critical issues being missed, resulting in customer dissatisfaction and potential harm to the organisation’s reputation.

3. Lack of Real-Time Feedback
The existing quality control process needs a swift feedback cycle for support agents. This limitation means that agents may miss the opportunity to address issues, resulting in suboptimal customer experiences promptly.

4. Resource Allocation
Organisations allocate substantial human resources to manual quality control efforts, resources that could be more strategically utilised for tasks like agent training and process improvement, rather than repetitive and time-consuming manual reviews.

5. Data-Driven Decision-Making
Organisations face challenges in gathering comprehensive data on conversations for analysis and improvement. The absence of data-driven insights hinders the ability to identify trends, patterns in agent performance, and areas for process optimisation.

Benefit of Sparks
1. Enhanced Operational Efficiency
Sparks are set to revolutionise the quality control process by automatically identifying and spotlighting critical instances within each conversation, be it in chat or voice. This eliminates the necessity for manual selection and review by human quality control, conserving valuable time and resources.

2. Elevated Precision
Through the thorough examination of every interaction via Sparks, we ensure a more comprehensive and consistent assessment of quality. This diminishes the risk of overlooking crucial issues or trends that might escape notice in manual sampling.

3. Swift Feedback in Real Time
Sparks introduces rapid feedback for agents on interactions, enabling them to make timely adjustments. This contributes to improved customer service and issue resolution, ultimately enhancing the overall quality of customer interactions.

4. Insights Driven by Data
Sparks empowers us to amass an extensive dataset on interactions, allowing the identification of common trends, patterns in agent performance, and areas for improvement in the support process. By leveraging this data, we can make informed, data-driven decisions to optimise our support operations.

5. Optimised Resource Utilisation
Through the automation of the quality control process, Sparks assists organisations in allocating human resources more effectively. Quality assurance teams can shift their focus to developing and refining Sparks’ algorithms and rules, reducing the substantial time spent on manual reviews.

6. Cost-Efficiency
The reduction in manual quality control efforts translates into cost savings over time. This encompasses diminished labour costs associated with manual quality checks and the potential for increased revenue through heightened customer satisfaction and retention.
