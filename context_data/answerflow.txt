New Generative AI Feature: Simplifying Document Cognition for Customer Support with AnswerFlow

In today’s fast-paced world, customer expectations demand immediate and precise responses from support agents, significantly impacting the overall customer experience. The time taken by agents to resolve customer queries has a proven effect on customer satisfaction, with studies indicating that 68% of customers are willing to pay more for better service and 89% are more likely to make repeat purchases after a positive support experience, according to Hubspot and Salesforce, respectively.

However, responding accurately to a wide range of customer queries can be challenging even for experienced agents, who often need to refer to various documents and training materials, impacting their response and resolution times.

To overcome this challenge, we have introduced a new feature called AnswerFlow. It is an innovative solution that leverages automated document cognition to help support agents access relevant answers from business documents. AnswerFlow assimilates extensive facts and information to answer any query instantly, recognising a customer’s intent and ensuring speedy resolution times.

By providing real-time access to relevant information and resolution answers from the company’s repository of documents via automated document cognition–this feature enables agents to respond to customer inquiries quickly and accurately.

Verloop.io’s platform allows businesses to upload documents, such as training materials, company policies, and pricing structures, with minimal effort. Our platform employs LLM models to process these documents automatically, enabling agents to access answers to any customer query directly from their live chat interface. With AnswerFlow, businesses can rest assured that their support team has the most up-to-date and accurate information at their fingertips, empowering them to deliver exceptional customer service.

Benefits of AnswerFlow

Here are some of the key benefits of using AnswerFlow:

1. Improved Response and Resolution Time
This feature eliminates the need for agents to search for multiple documents by hand or ask for help from their colleagues by quickly obtaining precise answers, thus decreasing the initial response time and overall query resolution time. AnswerFlow streamlines the process of responding to customer queries and resolving them by providing agents with real-time access to relevant information and training materials. With our Generative AI language features, agents can eliminate the task of writing messages. 

A study by Khoros suggests that 83% of customers are more loyal to brands that respond quickly to resolve customer queries. This saves time and ensures that customers receive prompt and accurate responses, improving response time and overall customer satisfaction.

2. Accurate Responses 
AnswerFlow enables customer support agents to access relevant information and training materials in real-time, eliminating the dependency on human memory or document searching. With advanced support LLM models and document cognition, Aidentifies the most pertinent resources for accurate responses, instilling customer confidence and loyalty. This level of support ensures that agents have access to the latest information and are equipped to handle a wide range of customer queries, even those that may be complex or unusual. 

3. Consistency
AnswerFlow offers a crucial advantage by providing a centralised repository of knowledge, which ensures consistent and up-to-date information for all customer support agents. This feature allows businesses to maintain a unified brand voice and tone, which is essential for maintaining a strong brand identity and customer loyalty. By updating the knowledge base, all agents have access to the same information, resulting in consistent responses and a positive customer experience.

With AnswerFlow’s multilingual support, users can now communicate effortlessly in their preferred language. The language support feature ensures that users receive prompt and efficient responses to their queries, irrespective of the document’s language or content. All users need to do is ask their questions in their preferred language. 

As an example, if a user poses a query in Arabic, the AnswerFlow, assisted by generative AI, will first translate the question into English (assuming the uploaded document is in English), then create a response for the agent in the language in which the query was asked.

Additionally, AnswerFlow’s support for multiple languages allows users to switch languages seamlessly in the same conversation.
